# cgiserver

**This is a CGI Script, running on an apache server configured for cgi scripts in DOCKER. It was made for a school assignement.**

* Most of the work here was done in the CGI-file "cgi-bin/database.cgi". 

* The CGI was implemented using bash scripting, and is supposed to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data from a RESTapi.

* POST, PUT, and DELETE requires the user to be logged in. (session cookie). But everybody should be able to use GET.

* The main focus here has been on functionality and not so much on the aesthetics.

* The job could probably be made easier using other languages, but we wanted to gain some more BASH scripting experience.
